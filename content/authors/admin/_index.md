I am an MS student of Entrepreneurship in Applied Technologies at the University of South Florida. My interest in Data Science led me to pursue courses from Business Analytics and Information Systems.

Core competence in setting up/restructuring operations and developing by implementing procedures/plans to enhance operational efficiency, optimize resource utilization and ensure adherence to quality norms. Strengths in statistical, business and data analysis; problem solving; and statistical modeling. Ability to lead, motivate and keep team members focused. Skilled at performing Gap analysis, Risk analysis, and Cost/Benefit analysis, along with good knowledge of process workflow tools and techniques.
